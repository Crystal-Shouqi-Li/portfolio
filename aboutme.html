    MACBETH: My name's Macbeth.  
  
    YOUNG SIWARD: The devil himself could not pronounce a title  
    More hateful to mine ear.  
  
    MACBETH: No, nor more fearful.  
  
    YOUNG SIWARD: Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword  
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.  
  
    [They fight, and young Seward is slain.]  
  
    MACBETH: Thou wast born of woman.--  
    But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,  
    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
